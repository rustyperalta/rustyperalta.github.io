      <div class="content">
        <p>Who is superior? That's a question with an answer that entirely depends on where he is present. While he is one person, the situations he tends find himself are often distant in correlation. Countless interests plague his mind in every moment of the day, feeding his struggle to understand his individuality. Is he even either name, Russell or Rusty?</p>
        <p>"Russell" is the name he was legally assigned to and "Rusty" is a name he lets people call him. He finds love in both names, although, neither of them did he ever personally choose. Who he is, and perhaps who everyone else may be, is far greater than the assigned names. We be who we want for whatever situations that are presented to us. What is necessary is the ability to step outside ourselves, outside the names free of judgement, giving observation toward what we choose in the moment. </p>
